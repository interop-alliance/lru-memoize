# @interop/lru-memoize ChangeLog

## 4.0.1 - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Fork to `@interop/lru-memoize` from `@digitalbazaar/lru-memoize@4`.
- Convert source to TypeScript.
- Replace mocha/karma/chai/webpack toolchain with vitest (Node) and Playwright
  (browser).
- Switch package manager from npm to pnpm.
- Require Node.js >=24.

## 4.0.0 - 2025-05-22

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use `lru-cache@11`. This replaces `lru-cache@6` which has a
  number of breaking changes that impact any use of this library that
  previously accessed the underlying cache interface. The main interface
  of this module has only changed in that the options it accepts when
  creating the cache need to now conform to v11 of `lru-cache` instead of
  v6. The v6 `maxAge` option, if given, will result in an error being thrown.
- **BREAKING**: The `delete()` method now returns `true` if the passed key was
  removed from the cache and `false` if not, matching the v11 `delete()`
  interface. Previously, `undefined` was returned in both cases.

## 3.0.2 - 2023-08-27

### Fixed
- Only remove promise entries from cache after settling if the entry has not
  changed.
